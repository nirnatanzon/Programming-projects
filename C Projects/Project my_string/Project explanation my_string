The program implements three string manipulation functions: `my_strcmp`, `my_strncmp`, and `my_strchr`. 

1. `my_strcmp` compares two strings lexicographically.
2. `my_strncmp` compares the first `n` characters of two strings.
3. `my_strchr` searches for a character in a string.

In the main function, the user can select which function to use and input necessary data for each function. The program repeats until the user chooses to exit.
