Summary:
The project is a simple game where a green circle needs to capture red squares.
Each captured square merges with the circle, reducing its size, and awards a point. The goal is to destroy all squares before they overflow the screen.

General Explanation:
- A simple game using the Pygame library for creating games and graphical applications.
- The user controls a green circle to capture red squares and merge them.
- Each captured square shrinks and merges with the circle, disappearing from the screen and awarding a point.
- The game ends when all squares are removed.
